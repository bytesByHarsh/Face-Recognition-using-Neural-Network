## Backpropogation
In artificial neural networks we use backpropagation to calculate a gradient that is needed in the calculation of the weights to be used in the network. This method is used to train deep neural networks i.e. networks with more than one hidden layer. It is equivalent to automatic differentiation in reverse accumulation mode. It requires the derivative of the loss function with respect to the network output to be known, which typically (but not necessarily) means that a desired target value is known. For this reason it is considered to be a supervised learning method.

## LVQ
LVQ stands for Learning Vector Quantization. It is a prototype-based supervised classification algorithm. LVQ is the supervised counterpart of vector quantization systems.
